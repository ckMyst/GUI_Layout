# GUI_Layout
This is the initial layout of the GUi. This is used to show how the program may initially function

The layout needs a review because the functionality of my program is backwards
I would like my program to have a main window with a button labeled "New Profile"
When this button is clicked on, it should open the main window (portrayed from all the function)
It should also close the previous window with .withdraw or .destroy in Tkinter
However, this is not the case as it puts a button on the main window and when clicked on 

You suggested that I should create a dropdown menu that has the option to create a new profile using SAVE, FILE, EDIT
I have no idea where to go from there
